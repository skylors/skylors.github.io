<h1>The Book of Mother Curie the Relevator</h1>
<h2>
Chapter 1<br>
1. As a young follower, verily I knew I was ordained unto a special service unto Atom.  <br>
2. And I resisted that whisper within me and doubted. <br>
3. But it came to pass that I fell asleep whilst the Atom's Confessor spake, and behold I was taken up into a dream.  <br>
4. Lo, a vision of the Prophet of Atom appeared, ablaze with holy light, and he spake unto my spirit.  <br>
5. He declared my destiny and my mission, and I heard the call and I answered the call.  <br>
6. I am called Mother Curie the Third, and I lead the Apostles of the Eternal Light.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 2<br>
1. Thusly did I receive a gift from Atom while I sat in meditation in Springvale.  <br>
2. For upon me came four armored angels of His, and they stood about my place.  <br>
3. When I declared that I hailed from Megaton, they delivered unto me barrels of Aqua Pura, saying, Give these unto thy people.  <br>
4. I could not abide to look upon their shining faces, and they withdrew from my sight.  <br>
5. Yea, I discerned Atom's message, and straightway I set myself to bless the water and to dispense it unto the world.  <br>
6. But when I gave thereof unto mine enlightened brethren, lo, they were smitten with grievous illness.  <br>
7. I questioned, Wherefore hast Thou sent pestilence upon us, O Atom? And I mourned.  <br>
8. Then I consecrated the waters with Atom's light, and lo, the pestilence was driven away and a most holy water was made manifest.  <br>
9. With this holy water we drink without dread, and when the Glow consumeth us, fear loseth dominion over us.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 3<br>
1. Atom appeared unto me with a vision of the hungry, the sick, and the weak, and he shewed that they should be made whole by the sacrament of his Glow.  <br>
2. He ordained that Enlightenment should be offered unto all that suffer by the waters of His Light.  <br>
3. When they are exposed unto Atom's supreme Glow, the sick are reborn in His shining likeness.  <br>
4. Many do misjudge Atom, and they dread the Glow as a scourge rather than behold it as mandkind's perfection.  <br>
5. Verily they that are reborn hunger not, they suffer not, neither do they wax old.  <br>
6. Our enlightened brethren require but to know Atom's Glow, and they shall be made glad.  <br>
7. We ply holy works, tending the afflicted and the hopeless, and our waters bring warmth unto those who else had perished unsaved.  <br>
8. Yet few of the supplicants attain the Eternal Light; the rest are contented with Enlightenment and the ending of their pain.  <br>
9. Let them therefore strive after Eternal Light.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 4<br>
1. Children of the Light, hearken unto my words and feel the warmth of Atom!  <br>
2. For long hath our world been barren, and our people become empty within.  <br>
3. Their hearts are become dry and cold, and thirst devoureth both the weak and the mighty.  <br>
4. But behold, we can succor them, for Atom's bounty hath bestowed upon us mercy and compassion.  <br>
5. O my brethren, let us minister unto them the Waters of Light!  <br>
6. Let them be fulfilled by Atom, let them know His Glow, and be truly Enlightened!  <br>
7. Let them live forever and walk with us in the grace of Atom's Glow, and be filled no more.  <br>
8. May they attain Eternal Light.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 5<br>
1. Call not Atom's reborn by the name of Ghouls, for they are enlightened and the reproachers envy their gifts.  <br>
2. We have been scourged with persecution for our faith, yet we renounce answering violence with violence.  <br>
3. Choose wisdom rather than the sword, for by wisdom cometh the better path, the path of Enlightenment. <br>
4. To receive such Enlightenment, the people must be brought into great exposure of Atom's Glow by His holy sacrament.  <br>
5. We proclaim salvation and not death, and let not the world fear the Light of Atom or His enlightened.  <br>
6. None may be forced into salvation against his will, for to compel would be injustice even in Atom's name.  <br>
7. We shall employ no guile to spread the tidings of Atom's light, for deceit makes a mockery of salvation.  <br>
8. Soon shall Atom enlighten thine eyes, and thou shalt perceive the truth in thine own sight.  <br>
9. The Prophet of Atom himself alone may preach His will, his eyes aflame and his flesh radiant with Atom's heat, yea, a man called of Atom to shine above the sun.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 6<br>
1. Unto those Gentiles who turn from the gift of the Great Division, Atom proffereth another way.  <br>
2. Atom calleth his children to attain Enlightenment by becoming one with His Glow, a transformation in Atom.  <br>
3. For now, leave the Great Symbol of Atom untouched, come ye unto Atom's apostles, and partake of Enlightenment.  <br>
4. The worthy shall seek us out, and therefore shall find the Message of Atom, and the Waters of Light shall be drunk into their souls.  <br>
5. Thus shall Atom be with thee, forevermore.<br>
