Chapter 1<br>
1 Behold, He cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall be blinded by His glory, and every ear made <small>deaf</small> by the thunder of His voice.<br>
2 Let the sons of men, and the daughters of women, yea, even the children of the earth, gather themselves together, and behold the might of atom.<br>
3 And let them that dwell in His chosen land give ear unto the words of the Prophet of Atom.<br>
4 Come ye forth, and drink of the waters of the Glow; for this weapon of ancient war is become our salvation, and the very ensign of Atomâ€™s majesty.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 2<br>
1 Let it be for a memorial of the Division that was aforetime, and for a token of the promise of the Division that is yet to come.<br>
2 Yield thy bodies unto Atom, O my brethren; submit thyselves unto His power, feel ye His Glow, and be ye Divided.<br>
3 For there shall be no tears, neither sorrow, neither suffering; for in the Division shall we find release from the travail of this world.<br>
4 Yea, thy grief shall be no more; it shall be consumed in the fire of His brilliance, and purged in the light of His Glow.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 3<br>
1 Each soul shall bring forth a multitude of stars, born of the dust of our vile and corrupted flesh.<br>
2 Each soul shall be both mother and father unto a thousand times a thousand generations.<br>
3 Each soul shall know peace, and the end of pain, and the glory of Atom.<br>
4 Therefore I beseech thee, my brethren, come ye, drink with me, and lift up thy prayers.<br>
5 O Glorious Atom, unto Thee I commend these feeble bones; unto Thy will I yield this frail body.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 4<br>
1 I entreat Thee, make me Thy vessel; guide me unto Thy brilliance; divide my substance, and grant release unto this decayed flesh.<br>
2 Cast this fleeting form into new life within the furnace of Thy Glow.<br>
3 We remain steadfast until the Day of Division, until the dawning of Thy return unto this lowly world. Amen.<br>
4 O Atom, descend, and bestow Thy presence upon Thy servant unworthy.<br>
