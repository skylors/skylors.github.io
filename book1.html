1 <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="img/behold.png"></img>, He cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall be <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="img/blinded.png"></img> by His glory, and every ear made <small>deaf</small> by the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="img/thunder.png"></img> of His voice.
<br>
2 <img style="vertical-align:middle"></img>Let the sons of men, and the daughters of women, yea, even the children of the earth, gather themselves together, and behold the might of <img src="img/atom.png"></img>.
<br>
3 And let them that dwell in His chosen land give ear unto the words of the Prophet of Atom.
<br>
4 Come ye forth, and drink of the waters of the Glow; for this weapon of ancient war is become our salvation, and the very ensign of Atomâ€™s majesty.
<br>
5 Let it be for a memorial of the Division that was aforetime, and for a token of the promise of the Division that is yet to come.
<br>
6 Yield thy bodies unto Atom, O my brethren; submit thyselves unto His power, feel ye His Glow, and be ye Divided.
<br>
7 For there shall be no tears, neither sorrow, neither suffering; for in the Division shall we find release from the travail of this world.
<br>
8 Yea, thy grief shall be no more; it shall be consumed in the fire of His brilliance, and purged in the light of His Glow.
<br>
9 Each soul shall bring forth a multitude of stars, born of the dust of our vile and corrupted flesh.
<br>
10 Each soul shall be both mother and father unto a thousand times a thousand generations.
<br>
11 Each soul shall know peace, and the end of pain, and the glory of Atom.
<br>
12 Therefore I beseech thee, my brethren, come ye, drink with me, and lift up thy prayers.
<br>
13 O Glorious Atom, unto Thee I commend these feeble bones; unto Thy will I yield this frail body.
<br>
14 I entreat Thee, make me Thy vessel; guide me unto Thy brilliance; divide my substance, and grant release unto this decayed flesh.
<br>
15 Cast this fleeting form into new life within the furnace of Thy Glow.
<br>
16 We remain steadfast until the Day of Division, until the dawning of Thy return unto this lowly world. Amen.
<br>
17 O Atom, descend, and bestow Thy presence upon Thy servant unworthy.
