<h1>The Book of the Great Division </h1>
<h2>
Chapter 1<br>
1. In the beginning Atom created the first division of light from darkness, and the name of the first is Fission.<br>
2. It is that which encompasseth the whole kingdom of Atom, wherein there is the glow.<br>
3. And the stars cast His glow upon the firmament, and through it creatures were divided from the earth and made with eyes to perceive His glory.<br>
4. And for a time the great division continued and created all manner of creature which tested themselves to be worthy of Atom.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 2<br>
1. Thus came forth man, who had the potential to understand the true form of Atom.<br>
2. But man was weak and, swayed by false gods, sought to enslave Atom wrapping his mortal gifts in the coils of a great copper wyrm.<br>
3. But His prophets were not swayed, and through them Atom's bonds were broken and His trumpets soundeth as the breaking of the world.<br>
4. And where His shackles were loosed a tree of light grew upon the earth and in its blooming, cast forth a cleansing fire.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 3<br>
1. The faithful knew that they still had His love; for where the tree bloomed His seal was placed upon the earth wherein they might drink the waters of the glow.<br>
2. Still the wicked did not believe and so stars of heaven fell upon the earth carried by winged chariots and his trumpets sounded for 40 days.<br>
3. Thus the land was cleansed and a second great division began.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 4<br>
1. But as with the wyrm, the unbelievers hid below the earth from the Eye of Atom, trapped in their ignorance.<br>
2. To they He has delivered new prophets and said unto them.<br>
3. I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water of the glow.<br>
4. And you shall wield the arrow of my judgement upon them.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 5<br>
1. Pity not the wailing of heretics, for their tears shall be dried in the flames.<br>
2. And their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet in the division.<br>
3. And their eyes shall consume away in their holes to behold the glory of Atom.<br>
4. And their tongue shall consume away in their mouth to better speak His name.<br>
5. And so shall you do my works upon the earth.<br>
<br>
