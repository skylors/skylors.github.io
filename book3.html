<h1>The Book of Mother Isolde the Pious </h1>
<h2>
Chapter 1 <br>
1. In the beginning Atom begat this world, and Atom begat all worlds that be.<br>
2. And Atom breathed forth a promise unto this world, even the promise of endless birth and renewal.<br>
3. For we are all, each one, universes without number, awaiting the Day of Division whereby they shall be made manifest.<br>
4. Fear not, O child, for Atom shall come unto us in His season; but little dismay toucheth the blessed.<br>
5. Atom provideth and defendeth all that accepteth His embrace, and none that trust in Him shall be forsaken.<br>

Chapter 2<br>
1. The Glowing Sea hath no turning, neither hath it circuit, but a straight path unto the Glow of Atom.<br>
2. Lo, Atom stretched forth His hand and laid His touch upon this earth, and His Glow was brought unto us.<br>
3. The Glow abideth even unto this day, a memorial of His covenant to His people.<br>
4. Behold, infinite worlds by Division, saith the word of Atom.<br>
5. To the south standeth an ancient pyramid, therein are stored Atom's gifts that men may bear forth the glory of His Division.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 3<br>
1. We are appointed keepers of Atom's light, and we shall walk circumspectly.<br>
2. We swear to keep that which Atom hath bestowed, preparing the way for His return.<br>
3. We publish Atom's word, and we bestow His gifts to the Commonwealth.<br>
4. The peoples shall behold the truth of Atom's Glow and their eyes shall be opened.<br>
5. He hath brought us unto this place, a place that harmeth us not, that we might worship before Him.<br>
6. Here do we hold communion with Atom, and hence we go forth to declare His law.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 4<br>
1. This is our calling, to deliver Atom's message unto a world that hearkeneth not.<br>
2. To show forth Atom's power unto all that dwell upon the earth.<br>
3. We had seen the Glow afar off, and it called unto us in the distance.<br>
4. Whereas others tremble before the Glowing Sea in fear, we entered in courage, knowing Atom would guide our feet.<br>
5. For our faith, we were granted a haven, sacred and pristine, a blessing from Atom.<br>
6. None lacking His favour may abide in such a place, yet by His gift we endure, for we are true believers.<br>
7. We question not the will of Atom, neither do we turn aside from His command.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 5<br>
1. Surely Atom hath blessed us exceedingly, and we shall repay by diffusing His Glow unto the nations.<br>
2. Behold, our life hath one aim, even to bring Atom's Divide unto the world.<br>
3. Therefore I beseech thee, let thy counsel be as ours, O child, that thy designs may agree with our purpose.<br>
4. Our adversaries hide and cloak themselves, seeking to escape Atom's power; but they strive in vain.<br>
5. They that rise against Atom shall not live to behold the Great Divide.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 5<br>
1. Wherefore comest thou unto Atom's holy ground?<br>
2. Seekest thou Division, to be made one with Atom and to be sundered in His endless glory?<br>
3. Or camest thou to root out His followers and to put down His faithful?<br>
4. This place is not for the forsaken; judgment is reserved for them that concern themselves with mortal matters.<br>
5. When thou speakest of Atom's gifts, let thy heart be true, for Atom discerneth the hidden thought.<br>
5. If thy heart be false, Atom shall perceive it and suffereth it not, and thou shalt taste His wrath.<br>
6. Repent therefore, and remove thyselve not from the glow, lest thou be cast out in the Day of Division.<br>
