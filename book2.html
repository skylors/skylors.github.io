The first of us, my predecessor Martin and I, had come north at the behest of Atom's great prophet, Confessor Cromwell.  We traveled from a small refuge in the Capital Wastes. When we arrived on the island, we found a few souls receptive to Atom's message.  Most thought us a menace. We were chased from the town, driven into the wilds. Barely escaped with our lives and some of us were never the same.  It was only thanks to the grace of Atom that we survived... and finally found a place that we could call home.  Atom watches over His children, and we have a responsibility to this island that we will not abandon.  Atom understands our devotion, He would never have claimed this land for us otherwise.  This place - the Nucleus, the island. Atom has claimed it all for us His chosen.

Our family has been blessed at birth with an affinity for the Glow. It's no more to us than a May rain warm, and comforting.  It is Atom’s greatest gift.  It's why a place like this island truly is meant for His children. Others simply whither away while we gladly await Division.  

Locked inside us all are billions of invisible worlds, waiting only to be touched by His Glow in order to be born anew through Division.  During the Great War, it was granted to many, though they certainly didn't realize it.  But today it is often a slow process, taking years of exposure in order to be realized.  We are all here to spend our lives seeking the promise of Division, however long it may take.  

The Mother is one of Atom's most revered messengers.  Many years ago, when we were driven from Far Harbor, it was she who guided us through the wilds to this sanctuary.  We might all have been lost if it wasn't for her.  Many of Atom's children spend their whole lives wishing for a witness of the Mother of the Fog.

The Fog predates our arrival on the island, certainly, but before us, it was but an occasional presence. Yet through our faith, our devotion to family, Atom saw fit to reach across the land claiming for us more, year after year, until near all lay beneath His grasp.  Have you seen Far Harbor’s barriers against Atom's holy Fog? It's citizens' blasphemous refusal to vacate what is clearly His domain?  The people of Far Harbor need only peer out their windows to look upon the face of Atom himself, given form in holy Fog!  Yet no matter how inevitable Atom's reign in this land may be, they deny it.

Brother Martin was sleeping in his chambers in the vessel, and the next morning, he'd simply vanished.  Perhaps he took up in Far Harbor or fled to the south. His dedication to Atom had become questionable after het let Far Harbor execute one of our missionaries.  Far Harbor has harmed your family and denied our brilliant Lord.

Our good Brother Andrews had decided to brave the Fog and attempt to bring Atom's Light to that ghastly town... and remind the heathens of their trespasses.  We tried to help them. To bring them Atom's light. Many of our brethren ended up dying for it.  To restore the missing piece of Atom's kingdom once and for all are you prepared to do what must be done?  Do not deep Atom waiting.  We will be victorious over those who fight against Atom, His holy Fog will overrun the town and with it the beasts of the fog.  Far Harbor will be no more so go and do what Atom put you on this Earth to do.  All Atom's foes will know that He is the sole master of this island.  Atom's veil will roll down its streets, holy Fog cleansing the land of their heresy!

when faced with an enemy who would see you hunted, beaten, and robbed of what is rightfully yours, there can be only one course of action.  The only way to deal with an infection - cleanse the wound and cauterize the flesh.  only a fool would allow a potentially deadly wound to fester.

So sayeth the Lord, learn of the coming fate of Far Harbor. Gone. Gone is that bastion of heresy. Gone is that seething cauldron of desecration, washed clean at last. Far Harbor's streets run thick with Fog, thanks to a champion.  This will be our moment, brothers and sisters. for thanks to Him, a new age begins!

Gather, brothers and sisters! Do you hear His chorus? Division is at hand!  Atom's divine plan for His children finally comes to realization!  He is come to deliver us from the iniquities of this existence! To finally set us free!  Too long have we languished in this place! The time has come to prove our devotion by embracing His holy light!  His voice shall boom! His radiance shall blind! And we shall at last be Divided! Prepare Children for our time is now!  So shall end an era of wickedness, and we Go forth in the age of Atom.  Now is the time of our ascendance!

Thank you blessed Atom, for sending us your champion. Grant me strength to lead them to glory, keep vigil for my enemies are many.  I am your chosen, thank you for your trust, brilliant lord, Far Harbor will pay for their sins, And when we are finally granted Division, it will be as heroes! A new day dawns, brothers and sisters!  Glory to Atom!

The Book of Tektus the Zealous

Chapter 1
1. And it came to pass that the first of us, even my predecessor Martin and I, journeyed north at the bidding of Atom's great prophet, the Confessor Cromwell.
2. For we had travelled from a small refuge in the Capital Wastes, and when we arrived upon the island we found a few hearts open 3. unto Atom's message.
3. But the greater part regarded us as a menace, and they chased us from the town, and did drive us into the wilds.
4. Yea, we scarce escaped with our lives, and many among us had a fallen countenance.
5. Yet by the grace of Atom we were preserved, and at length we found a place which we might call home.
6. Behold, Atom watcheth over His children, and we have a charge concerning this island which we shall not forsake.
7. Atom comprehendeth our devotion; otherwise He would not have claimed this land for us.
8. This place is called the Nucleus, and the island Atom hath laid claim to it for us, His chosen.

Chapter 2
1. Your Prophet, Brother Martin had lay sleeping in his chambers, but on the morrow he was gone.
2. Peradventure he betook himself to Far Harbor, or fled unto the south; his devotion had grown doubtful after he suffered Far Harbor to execute one of your missionaries.
3. Far Harbor hath wronged thy family and hath denied our brilliant Lord.
4. Our good Brother Andrews did resolve to brave the Fog, to bear Atom's Light unto that dread town and to admonish the heathen for their trespasses.
5. We strove to succour them and to bring unto them Atom's light, and many of our brethren died in that endeavour.
6. Shall we not labour to restore the missing fragment of Atom's kingdom once and for all?
7. Be ye prepared to do that which must be done; defer not the service of Atom.

Chapter 3
1. Our household hath been exceedingly blessed from birth with an affinity for the Glow.
2. To us it is as spring rain, warm and comforting, lo Atom's greatest gift.
3. Wherefore a place such as this island is meet for His children; others wither, but we await with gladness the day of Division.
4. Lo, within each of us are locked billions of invisible worlds, awaiting His Glow that they may be born anew through Division.
5. In the days of the Great War many received it, though they perceived it not.
6. But in these latter days it is oft a slow thing, requiring years of exposure ere it be fulfilled.
7. Therefore are we gathered here to spend our lives in seeking the promise of Division, whatsoever the length thereof.

Chapter 4
1. The Mother of the Fog is accounted among Atom's most honoured messengers.
2. In the years when we were driven from Far Harbor, it was she who guided us through the wilds unto this sanctuary.
3. Had it not been for her, we would have perished; and many of Atom's children yearn all their days for a sight of the Mother of the Fog.

Chapter 5
1. The Fog was upon the land even before our coming, yet erstwhile it was but an occasional presence.
2. But through our faith and our devotion to kindred, Atom stretched forth His hand across the land and did claim more for us, year by year, until nigh all lay under His reach.
3. Hast thou beheld Far Harbor's barriers against Atom's holy Fog, the people's blasphemous refusal to yield that which is plainly His?
4. They need only look from their windows and behold the face of Atom made manifest in holy Fog, and yet they deny.


Chapter 6
1. We shall be victorious over those that resist Atom; His holy Fog shall overrun the town and with it the beasts that walk therein.
2. Far Harbor shall be no more; go forth and perform that work whereunto Atom hath set thee upon the earth.
3. All the foes of Atom shall know that He alone is lord of this island; His veil shall roll down the streets, and holy Fog shall cleanse the land of their iniquity.
4. When thou art beset by an enemy that would hunt thee, beat thee, and rob thee of thy right, there is but one course of action.
5. For the manner to deal with an infection is to cleanse the wound and to cauterize the flesh; a fool letteth a mortal wound to fester.
6. Thus saith the Lord: Hear of the coming doom of Far Harbor, it shall be gone.
7. Gone is that bulwark of heresy; gone is that seething cauldron of desecration, washed at length.
8. The streets of Far Harbor shall run thick with Fog by the hand of a champion; this shall be our season, O brethren.
9. Behold, for by Him a new age shall arise.

Chapter 7
1. Assemble, brethren and sisters; hearken unto His chorus, for Division draweth nigh.
2. Atom's divine counsel for His children now maketh itself manifest.
3. He cometh to deliver us from the iniquities of this existence and to free us of earthly bonds.
4. Long have we languished in this place; the time is come to show our devotion by embracing His holy light.
5. His voice shall sound as a trumpet and His radiance shall blind; then shall we be Divided.
6. Make ready, O children, for our hour is at hand.
7. So shall an era of wickedness end, and we shall go forth in the age of Atom.
8. Now is the time of our exaltation.

Chapter 8
1. Blessed be Atom for sending unto us His champion.
2. Grant unto me strength to lead the children unto glory; keep watch, for mine enemies are many.
3. I am chosen; I give thanks for His trust, brilliant Lord, and Far Harbor shall answer for their sins.
4. And when at last we obtain Division, we shall be as unto heroes.
5. A new day dawneth, brethren and sisters; glory be unto Atom.
