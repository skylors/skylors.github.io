<h1>The Book of Tektus the Zealous</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>
Chapter 1<br>
1. And it came to pass that the first of us, even my predecessor Martin and I, journeyed north at the bidding of Atom's great prophet, the Confessor Cromwell.<br>
2. For we had travelled from a small refuge in the Capital Wastes, and when we arrived upon the island we found a few hearts open 3. unto Atom's message.<br>
3. But the greater part regarded us as a menace, and they chased us from the town, and did drive us into the wilds.<br>
4. Yea, we scarce escaped with our lives, and many among us had a fallen countenance.<br>
5. Yet by the grace of Atom we were preserved, and at length we found a place which we might call home.<br>
6. Behold, Atom watcheth over His children, and we have a charge concerning this island which we shall not forsake.<br>
7. Atom comprehendeth our devotion; otherwise He would not have claimed this land for us.<br>
8. This place is called the Nucleus, and the island Atom hath laid claim to it for us, His chosen.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 2<br>
1. Your Prophet, Brother Martin had lay sleeping in his chambers, but on the morrow he was gone.<br>
2. Peradventure he betook himself to Far Harbor, or fled unto the south; his devotion had grown doubtful after he suffered Far Harbor to execute one of your missionaries.<br>
3. Far Harbor hath wronged thy family and hath denied our brilliant Lord.<br>
4. Our good Brother Andrews did resolve to brave the Fog, to bear Atom's Light unto that dread town and to admonish the heathen for their trespasses.<br>
5. We strove to succour them and to bring unto them Atom's light, and many of our brethren died in that endeavour.<br>
6. Shall we not labour to restore the missing fragment of Atom's kingdom once and for all?<br>
7. Be ye prepared to do that which must be done; defer not the service of Atom.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 3<br>
1. Our household hath been exceedingly blessed from birth with an affinity for the Glow.<br>
2. To us it is as spring rain, warm and comforting, lo Atom's greatest gift.<br>
3. Wherefore a place such as this island is meet for His children; others wither, but we await with gladness the day of Division.<br>
4. Lo, within each of us are locked billions of invisible worlds, awaiting His Glow that they may be born anew through Division.<br>
5. In the days of the Great War many received it, though they perceived it not.<br>
6. But in these latter days it is oft a slow thing, requiring years of exposure ere it be fulfilled.<br>
7. Therefore are we gathered here to spend our lives in seeking the promise of Division, whatsoever the length thereof.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 4<br>
1. The Mother of the Fog is accounted among Atom's most honoured messengers.<br>
2. In the years when we were driven from Far Harbor, it was she who guided us through the wilds unto this sanctuary.<br>
3. Had it not been for her, we would have perished; and many of Atom's children yearn all their days for a sight of the Mother of the Fog.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 5<br>
1. The Fog was upon the land even before our coming, yet erstwhile it was but an occasional presence.<br>
2. But through our faith and our devotion to kindred, Atom stretched forth His hand across the land and did claim more for us, year by year, until nigh all lay under His reach.<br>
3. Hast thou beheld Far Harbor's barriers against Atom's holy Fog, the people's blasphemous refusal to yield that which is plainly His?<br>
4. They need only look from their windows and behold the face of Atom made manifest in holy Fog, and yet they deny.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 6<br>
1. We shall be victorious over those that resist Atom; His holy Fog shall overrun the town and with it the beasts that walk therein.<br>
2. Far Harbor shall be no more; go forth and perform that work whereunto Atom hath set thee upon the earth.<br>
3. All the foes of Atom shall know that He alone is lord of this island; His veil shall roll down the streets, and holy Fog shall cleanse the land of their iniquity.<br>
4. When thou art beset by an enemy that would hunt thee, beat thee, and rob thee of thy right, there is but one course of action.<br>
5. For the manner to deal with an infection is to cleanse the wound and to cauterize the flesh; a fool letteth a mortal wound to fester.<br>
6. Thus saith the Lord: Hear of the coming doom of Far Harbor, it shall be gone.<br>
7. Gone is that bulwark of heresy; gone is that seething cauldron of desecration, washed at length.<br>
8. The streets of Far Harbor shall run thick with Fog by the hand of a champion; this shall be our season, O brethren.<br>
9. Behold, for by Him a new age shall arise.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 7<br>
1. Assemble, brethren and sisters; hearken unto His chorus, for Division draweth nigh.<br>
2. Atom's divine counsel for His children now maketh itself manifest.<br>
3. He cometh to deliver us from the iniquities of this existence and to free us of earthly bonds.<br>
4. Long have we languished in this place; the time is come to show our devotion by embracing His holy light.<br>
5. His voice shall sound as a trumpet and His radiance shall blind; then shall we be Divided.<br>
6. Make ready, O children, for our hour is at hand.<br>
7. So shall an era of wickedness end, and we shall go forth in the age of Atom.<br>
8. Now is the time of our exaltation.<br>
<br><br>
Chapter 8<br>
1. Blessed be Atom for sending unto us His champion.<br>
2. Grant unto me strength to lead the children unto glory; keep watch, for mine enemies are many.<br>
3. I am chosen; I give thanks for His trust, brilliant Lord, and Far Harbor shall answer for their sins.<br>
4. And when at last we obtain Division, we shall be as unto heroes.<br>
5. A new day dawneth, brethren and sisters; glory be unto Atom.<br>
